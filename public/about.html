<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Giovanni, and i am a brand new web developer student.
  I am currently going through the complete web developer bootcamp created
 by Angela Yu. I found this bootcamp through a source who recommended it through Udemy.com.
 My goal is to complete this bootcamp and hopefully become a full stack developer and 
 become the next Angela Yu, and help other people become developers aswell. But in the meantime
 i am currently working as a construction worker while at the same time going through this bootcamp.
 I also look forward to being able to work from home and dedicate even more time in this field.
</p>
